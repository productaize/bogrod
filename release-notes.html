<h3 id="FOO_1.0.0-8_Prelude">Prelude</h3>
<p>Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for this release. All of the prelude content is merged together and then rendered separately from the items listed in other parts of the file, so the text needs to be worded so that both the prelude and the other items make sense when read independently. This may mean repeating some details. Not every release note requires a prelude. Usually only notes describing major features or adding release theme details should have a prelude.</p>
