bogrod.util.tabulate_data:
    objective: |
        Act as a senior python developer. I have a list of dict like this:

        data = [{ 'severity': 'high', 'status': 'open', 'response': 'not_affected' }, ... ]

        I want to tabulate this data by severity and status, where severity is in rows,
        status is in columns. Each cell of the table should be the count of the respective criteria.
        Provide a pure-python leightweight function or recommend a pypi package that does this
        (do not use pandas or numpy).

        The function shall take as input kwargs "index=" (the key for the row values), and "columns="
        (the list of columns to tabulate against). It shall be able to handle any number of columns.

        Use collections.Counter and the tabulate module. In the case of combined columns, output a table
        that splits the header into the values of each combination (one value per line).

        Count occurrences for each combination of index and columns
    prompts:
        - |
            This does not work. I get this output:

                            Severity State
            --------  --  ----------------
            critical   0                 3
            high       1                28
            Total      0                 0
